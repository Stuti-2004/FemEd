          <h3> Nettie Stevens </h3>
          <p>After teaching at State Normal School for 3 years, Nettie entered Stanford University where she earned a B.A. and M.A., she soon earned her PhD from Bryn Mawr college.

          </p>

          <p><b>Notable Achievement</b></p>
          <p>She discovered that an individual's sex is dependent on XX and XY chromosones. The discovery was falsely credited to her colleague E.B. Wilson. Although she published the paper first and her work was eventually shown to be more correct, for years, she was described as a "lab technician".</p>

          <h3> Margaret Hamilton </h3>
          <p>
            After studying mathematics and philosophy in college, Margaret soon became the director of the Software Engineering Division of MIT, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program.

          </p>

          <p><b>Notable Achievement</b></p>
          <p>
            Hamilton, an American computer pioneer, software, engineer, mother, and business owner played a critical role in landing astronauts on the moon on July 20th 1969. The program needed to identify errors and recover from them in real time, a concept that was unheard of at the time. This led to her designing the very first asynchronous system, where the software's more important jobs could interrupt the current ones. Margaret's rigorous approach was so successful that no software bugs were ever known to have occurred during any crewed Apollo missions.
